What Didn't Work
=================
- Rogue seemed OP
  - merchant gave ability to play more / cost less
  - bag of tricks gave full deck access
- Warrior died quickly
  - no significant damage preventions
- Merchant may have complicated things?
  - spent whole game hiding (Ramon enjoyed that, did others?)
  - no significant consistent ability to damage mobs
  - great mob damage after lots of buildup
- Shaman usefulness was unclear
  - Summoning spirits wasn't quite working
  - Things cost too much? (siphon life)
  - No significant blocking?
- Took too long to really get started with abilities
- 10 or so rounds before we had good abilities
  - increase start XP?
- Dungeons 2 & 3 were very easy compared to 1
- Dungeon 1 had too much mob management
- Rogue was cleaning a lot up before melee classes could even act
  - Made Warrior feel very useless


What did work
=================
- Rogue was very useful
  - ranged / melee abilities
- Merchant was dodging a lot of damage
- Dungeon 1 was very difficult
  - May be due to number of mobs?
- Ranged vs. Melee timing seems good


Learnings
================
- Bring back "kill mob, boss gets XP"
- Melee classes need ability to be interactive before mobs attack
  ? More abilities that are "play anytime"
  ? Change timing elements for mob attack
- Attack/Defense need to scale with dungeons
? Add more consistent health
  - You always have same amount of health
  - You have more ways to heal
  - You rely on guarding your health, instead of increasing health (armor)


Big Changeables
================
- Chance for miss from mob attacks
- Change the attack order
  ? Players attack first
  ? Mobs attack in lanes, each hero deals with their own mob lane
  ? Mobs attack in lanes, and each hero can choose to 
    fight them or save for other lane
- Attacked mob moves in front of player for 1v1 combat


Other Card Changes
================
- Bag of tricks
  - lvl 1: costs 2xp, goes back into purchase pile
  - lvl 2: costs 5xp, goes back into deck
  - lvl 3: costs 8px, goes ?
- In Hide: can play all cards except attack/defend
- Siphon Life: change cost
- Herbs: heals 3 life, then 1 every 3 turns
